# Java Operators Training

## Overview

This module covers all types of operators in Java, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.

## Training Content

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

- Basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Increment/Decrement: `++`, `--`
- Practical exercises with different data types

### 2. Relational Operators

- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Boolean results and conditional logic
- Common pitfalls with object comparison

### 3. Logical Operators

- Boolean operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Short-circuit evaluation
- Truth tables and practical applications

### 4. Bitwise Operators

- Bit manipulation: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`
- Practical use cases in low-level programming

### 5. Assignment Operators

- Basic assignment: `=`
- Compound assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, etc.
- Best practices for clean code

### 6. Ternary Operator

- Conditional operator: `? :`
- When to use vs if-else statements

## Hands-on Exercises

1. Create a calculator program using arithmetic operators
2. Implement a grading system using relational and logical operators
3. Write a program that demonstrates bitwise operations
4. Build a simple decision-making application using ternary operators

## Assessment

- Multiple choice quiz on operator precedence
- Coding challenge: Implement a complex expression evaluator
- Debugging exercise: Fix operator-related bugs in provided code
