# Java Inheritance and Polymorphism Training

## Overview
This module covers object-oriented programming concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java.

## Training Content

### 1. Inheritance Fundamentals
- Extends keyword and class hierarchy
- Superclass and subclass relationships
- Constructor chaining with super()
- Method overriding rules

### 2. Types of Inheritance
- Single inheritance
- Multi-level inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Java's approach to multiple inheritance

### 3. Polymorphism Concepts
- Compile-time vs runtime polymorphism
- Method overloading (compile-time)
- Method overriding (runtime)
- Dynamic method dispatch

### 4. Abstract Classes
- Abstract methods and classes
- When to use abstraction
- Abstract vs concrete classes
- Design patterns using abstraction

### 5. Final Keyword
- Final classes, methods, and variables
- Implications for inheritance
- Best practices for using final

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Create an inheritance hierarchy for a vehicle system
2. Build a shape drawing application demonstrating polymorphism
3. Implement an abstract class for a payment processing system
4. Develop a game character system with inheritance
5. Create a final class demonstration

## Assessment
- Coding challenge: Implement a complex inheritance hierarchy
