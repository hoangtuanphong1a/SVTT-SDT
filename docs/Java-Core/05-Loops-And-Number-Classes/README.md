# Java Loops and Number Classes Training

## Overview
This module covers control flow with loops and working with number wrapper classes in Java.

## Training Content

### 1. Loop Fundamentals
- `for` loops: structure and use cases
- `while` loops: when to use and common patterns
- `do-while` loops: guaranteed execution
- Loop control statements: `break`, `continue`, labeled breaks

### 2. Enhanced For Loop
- Syntax and usage with arrays and collections
- Limitations and when to use traditional for loops

### 3. Nested Loops
- Multi-dimensional iteration patterns
- Performance considerations
- Practical examples (matrices, patterns)

### 4. Number Wrapper Classes
- `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`
- Boxing and unboxing
- Utility methods and constants
- Parsing and formatting

### 5. Math Class
- Common mathematical operations
- Random number generation
- Constants and utility methods

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Implement Fibonacci sequence using different loop types
2. Create a number guessing game
3. Build a prime number generator
4. Develop a simple calculator with loop-based menu
5. Write a program that demonstrates boxing/unboxing

## Assessment
- Coding challenge: Implement complex loop patterns
- Debugging exercise: Fix infinite loops and logic errors
- Quiz on number class methods and best practices
